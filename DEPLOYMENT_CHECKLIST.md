## Deployment Steps

### 1. 🔧 Environment Preparation
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
npm install

# Verify environment variables are set
# (No new environment variables required)

# Check system resources
node -e "console.log('Memory:', process.memoryUsage())"
```

### 2. 🧪 Pre-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm test

# Run enhanced system validation
node test-enhanced-system.js

# Verify all services are responding
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### 3. 🚀 Deployment Process
```bash
# For Google Cloud Run deployment
gcloud run deploy neurastack-backend \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 2Gi \
  --cpu 2 \
  --timeout 300s \
  --max-instances 10

# For local deployment
npm start
```

### 4. 📊 Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Test enhanced ensemble endpoint
curl -X POST https://neurastack-backend-638289111765.us-central1.run.app/default-ensemble \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Test enhanced system deployment"}'

# Verify metrics endpoint
curl https://neurastack-backend-638289111765.us-central1.run.app/metrics

# Check health status
curl https://neurastack-backend-638289111765.us-central1.run.app/health
```

## Performance Monitoring

### 📈 Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Response Quality**: Target >85% average quality score
2. **Response Time**: Target <10 seconds average
3. **Cache Hit Rate**: Target >60% for similar requests
4. **System Uptime**: Target >99.5%
5. **Error Rate**: Target <2%
6. **Model Performance**: Monitor individual model success rates

### 🔍 Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check system metrics
curl https://neurastack-backend-638289111765.us-central1.run.app/metrics | jq '.system'

# Monitor ensemble performance
curl https://neurastack-backend-638289111765.us-central1.run.app/metrics | jq '.ensemble'

# Check vendor status
curl https://neurastack-backend-638289111765.us-central1.run.app/metrics | jq '.vendors'
```

## Rollback Plan

### 🔄 If Issues Arise
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert to previous deployment
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Enhanced system includes automatic fallbacks
3. **Service Isolation**: Individual enhanced services can be disabled
4. **Legacy Mode**: System can operate in legacy mode if needed

### 🛠️ Rollback Commands
```bash
# Revert to previous Cloud Run revision
gcloud run services update-traffic neurastack-backend \
  --to-revisions=PREVIOUS_REVISION=100 \
  --region us-central1

# Or deploy previous version
git checkout PREVIOUS_COMMIT
gcloud run deploy neurastack-backend --source . --region us-central1
```

## Feature Flags and Configuration

### 🎛️ Runtime Configuration
The enhanced system includes intelligent defaults and can be configured through:
- Dynamic configuration adjustments
- Feature toggles for individual enhancements
- Performance threshold adjustments
- Quality validation settings

### 🔧 Configuration Options
```javascript
// Example configuration adjustments (if needed)
const config = {
  enableIntelligentRouting: true,
  enableAdvancedSynthesis: true,
  enableSophisticatedVoting: true,
  enablePerformanceOptimization: true,
  enableQualityAssurance: true,
  qualityThreshold: 0.7,
  cacheHitRateTarget: 0.6
};
```
