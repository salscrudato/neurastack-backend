   - Check OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
   - Verify OpenAI API quota and rate limits

2. **Historical performance not updating**
   - Check Firebase/Firestore connection
   - Verify service account credentials

3. **High abstention rates**
   - Review model configurations
   - Check API response quality
   - Adjust abstention thresholds if needed

4. **Performance issues**
   - Monitor processing times in analytics
   - Consider adjusting timeout values
   - Check concurrent request limits

### Error Codes
- `sophisticatedVotingFailed: true` - System fell back to traditional voting
- `fallbackUsed: true` - Emergency fallback was triggered
- `abstentionTriggered: true` - Quality was too low, re-query recommended

## üîÑ Migration from Traditional Voting

The sophisticated voting system is fully backward compatible:

1. **Existing API calls** continue to work unchanged
2. **Response structure** maintains all original fields
3. **New fields** are additive and optional
4. **Version number** updated to 4.0 to indicate enhancement

### Gradual Adoption
